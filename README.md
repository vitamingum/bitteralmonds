Project Proposal: Development of a Non-Toxic Bitter Almond Cultivar
# Project Proposal: Development of a Non-Toxic Bitter Almond Cultivar

## Opening Statement
For centuries, bitter almonds have been prized for their **exceptional flavor**—the nutty, cherry-like aroma that defines amaretto, marzipan, and countless confections. Yet their natural cyanogenic glycosides make them unsafe to eat in raw form. If toxicity could be safely removed, the world would gain access to a **new premium almond cultivar** combining the unmatched taste of bitter almonds with the food safety and versatility of sweet almonds. This proposal seeks to make that possibility real.

## Project Goal
To apply modern molecular breeding techniques, including CRISPR-based gene editing, to generate an almond line in which **amygdalin biosynthesis in the kernel is suppressed** while maintaining all the agronomic, nutritional, and flavor traits of bitter almonds.

---

## Objectives
1. **Gene target validation**  
   Confirm sequence and function of the *Sk* locus controlling amygdalin accumulation.  

2. **Genome editing**  
   Apply CRISPR/Cas9 or equivalent targeted mutagenesis to disrupt the functional bitter allele.  

3. **Plant regeneration**  
   Develop viable seedlings through embryo culture and/or micrografting.  

4. **Phenotypic validation**  
   - *Biochemical*: Quantify amygdalin reduction (HPLC/LC–MS).  
   - *Sensory*: Verify kernel flavor intensity relative to sweet almond controls.  

5. **Field trials**  
   Evaluate edited lines for yield, pest resistance, and flavor consistency.

## Commercial Rationale
- **Market Size**: Global almond industry ~$20B/year; premium segment (Marcona, organic, specialty) ~10% of total.  
- **Opportunity**: A safe bitter almond could capture **1–3% of the global market** ($200M–$600M/year), with wholesale pricing 2–3× commodity almonds.  
- **Applications**: Direct consumption, confectionery, liqueurs, flavor extracts, and luxury nut markets.  
- **Strategic Advantage**: First-to-market cultivar with patent protection and strong branding potential.

---

## Proposed Collaboration Model
- **Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA)** between sponsor and UC Davis Almond Breeding Program.  
- **Deliverables**: Edited seedlings, biochemical data, greenhouse performance report.  
- **Timeline**: 24–36 months.  
- **Budget Range**: $300k–$600k (depending on scope of regeneration and field validation).

## Next Steps
1. Initial scoping call with UC Davis Almond Breeding Program and Seed Biotechnology Center.  
2. Alignment on project deliverables and IP/licensing framework.  
3. Drafting of formal Sponsored Research Agreement.
